#GEN-KEY

SHORT DESCRIPTION
--------------------
Generate a pair of private/public SSH key & several useful variation files seamlessly at once.

LONG DESCRIPTION
--------------------
This script aims to generate a set of SSH key files in order to authenticate with a public key on a SSH/SFTP server.

Files that will be generated:

- {ALIAS}-key.prv => generated by openssl
- {ALIAS}-key.crt => generated by openssl
- {ALIAS}-key.pub => generated by openssl
- {ALIAS}-key.ssh.prv => generated by ssh-keygen, can be used by any SFTP client
- {ALIAS}-key.ssh.pub => generated by ssh-keygen, can be used by any SFTP server
- {ALIAS}-key.p12 => generated by openssl, format used by some proprietary solutions

Those files will be saved into the folder "{ALIAS}-key", at the root of the command's execution.

WHAT ARE THE STEPS
--------------------
1. Ask for an alias that will be used as a prefix for all filenames, as described above. Default will be "default", meaning "default-key.prv" for the first file for instance.
2. Then a passphrase will be generated by default, 20 characters minimum, with diceware strategy. A boolean prompt is proposed before to the user, if he ants to create the passphrase himself.
3. Once all those details are gathered, a private key "{ALIAS}-key.prv" will be generated with the previous passphrase, while creating a certificate file "{ALIAS}-key.crt", thanks to openssl.
4. Then this private key will be converted to "{ALIAS}-key.ssh.prv", which is a more friendly format, thanks to ssh-keygen (openssh), accepted by all major SSH/SFTP client softwares.
5. After that tt comes the time to create the public key, from the initial private key, thanks to openssl.
6. Then this public key will be converted to "{ALIAS}-key.ssh.pub", including which is a more friendly format, thanks to ssh-keygen (openssh), accepted by all major SSH/SFTP servers.
7. Finally, a private .p12 key will be generated, a format used by some proprietary solutions.
8. The passphrase will be displayed 60 seconds, then the terminal will be cleared, as a safety measure.
